# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project demonstrates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification, a core task in computer vision. We use CNNs to classify images into different categories using the **Car-Plane-Ship** dataset from Kaggle. CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical patterns in image data.

## Project Overview
In this project, we apply CNNs to the task of image classification. CNNs use convolutional layers to extract features from images, making them well-suited for vision tasks like object detection and classification. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to preprocess the data, build a CNN model using **Keras**, and train the model to classify images into three categories: **Car**, **Plane**, and **Ship**.

---

## Objectives
- Download and preprocess the **Car-Plane-Ship** image dataset.
- Build a CNN architecture using Keras to classify images into the correct category.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy.
- Visualize the training process and classification results.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the model and handling data.
- **Keras/TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Car-Plane-Ship** classification dataset from Kaggle. It contains labeled images of cars, planes, and ships. These images are used to train the CNN model to classify unseen images into one of these three categories.

### Dataset Link:
The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abtabm/multiclassimagedatasetairplanecar).

### Download Instructions:
To download the dataset:
1. Create an account on **Kaggle**.
2. Go to Account -> **Create New API Token**.
3. Download the generated JSON file, which contains the username and API key. You will need this to download the dataset programmatically in the notebook.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
   - Load the images and preprocess them (resize, normalize, etc.) for input into the CNN.

2. **CNN Architecture**:
   - Build a Convolutional Neural Network using **Keras**. The model includes:
     - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
     - MaxPooling layers for down-sampling.
     - Fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the CNN using the training data, applying backpropagation to optimize the weights.
   - Use techniques like **data augmentation** to improve model generalization.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset using accuracy and other metrics.
   - Visualize the training history (accuracy, loss) and classification results with confusion matrices and prediction samples.
